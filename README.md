# Climb-Documentation
Public Documentation for the cubesat Climb project.

### In github there are following possibilities to write and maintain project documentation:

* Structure of MD Files checked in the master branch of the '<>code' section
* A project 'landing' website (for this repos here: https://carstenscharlemann.github.io/Climb-Documentation/). The sources are taken from the /docs folder in the master branch.
* A Wiki page available per repository ( [here](https://github.com/carstenscharlemann/Climb-Documentation/wiki) )
* A List of 'Projects' (Sub tasks bigger than issues). Each project has its own Project-Board (e.g.: [here](https://github.com/carstenscharlemann/Climb-Documentation/projects/1)).
