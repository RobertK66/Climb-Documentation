## Code Files in master

If you do not want to use a local git tool working on its local repository copy, you can use githubs WEB interface for creating and editing files in the code branches.

1.  Make sure you have selected the master branch.
2.  Navigate to the file/directory you want to apply your changes
3.  Creating and Editing
    - Edit an existing file by usintg the Edit symbol in the files viewer section
    - create a <b>new file</b> by using one of the buttons on the right side of the navigation line.
    - create a <b>new directory</b> by creating a (dummy file and) typing "/dirx/diry/.." in front of the filename.
    - Mova a file: 
      - Edit the file
      - type into the filename field in the navigation line. Typing new sub dirs with / and ../ changes the current dir gets you where you want.
4.  Save the file by pressing the green button "Commit changes" (to the master branch). Optionaly you can describe your changes and reasoning for changes in the desccription boxes.
